@h2{What is the Market Place for?}

The OpenMOLE Market Place is accessible through this @aa("repository", href := shared.link.repo.market) or directly from the GUI application: @i{New Project > From Market Place}.
Clicking on a project will download it in the application, and you will be able to run it immediately!

@br

There you will find examples handling some use cases of OpenMOLE.
Don't focus too much on the applications or programming languages serving as a use case, these examples are more about how to do things the OpenMOLE way.



@h2{Sneak peek into the Market Place contents}

@h3{Hello World}
These examples demonstrate how to plug models written in different languages in OpenMOLE.
There are examples for R, Scilab, and Java.
For Java, there are two examples: one to plug the Java model as any other language, and the second to embed it as a plugin.


@h3{Applicative tutorials}
@ul
  @li
    @b{Native application} how to package your own application on Linux to make it portable and explore it with OpenMOLE
  @li
    @b{Workflow example} basic principles of OpenMOLE
  @li
    @b{Model exploration}
  @li
    @b{Approximate Bayesian Computation}

Some of these tutorials are also detailed in the @aa("Tutorials", href := tutorials.file) section.


@h3{NetLogo examples}
There are a number of NetLogo examples, to illustrate various OpenMOLE methods.
Two classic NetLogo models are used in these examples: the Fire model and the Ants model.

@br

Not all examples are listed here, for a full list look at the GitHub @aa("repository", href := shared.link.repo.market) or in the GUI.

@h2{Contribute your example/tutorial!}

You can contribute to the market place either by making a pull request on the @aa("central OpenMOLE market place", href := shared.link.repo.market), or by pushing your example workflow on your own git repository and post it to the @aa("user mailing list", href:=shared.link.forum).

@br

To contribute to the market place you should only provide @b{self-contained working examples}.
All resources needed to execute the workflow should be located in a single directory.
One or several @i(".oms") files can be provided, and a @i{README.md} must explain what the workflow computes.
A workflow is included in this section @b{only if it compiles} within the matching OpenMOLE version.
