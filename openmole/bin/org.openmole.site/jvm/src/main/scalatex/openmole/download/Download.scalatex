@h2{Try our demo website}

Before downloading OpenMOLE, you might want to get a preview of what you can do with it.
You can try OpenMOLE online using our @aa("demo website", href := shared.link.demo).
Please note that the service is reset every 6 hours, so don't be surprised if your current script suddenly vanishes :-)



@h2{Install OpenMOLE}
@h3{Prerequisites}

@ul
  @li{@i{Java >= 11}: to run on your own computer, OpenMOLE requires Java version 11 or above. Check our @aa("FAQ", href := faq.file) to access your Java version information.}
  @li{@i{Singularity}: some OpenMOLE tasks require @org.openmole.site.content.Native.singularity. You must install it on your system if you want to use some tasks such as Python, R, Scilab, Container.}


@h3{Download}

When Java is installed, you just need to download and extract the archive below, and you're done!
OpenMOLE is installed and works out of the box!

@br

@linkButton(s"Download ${org.openmole.core.buildinfo.version.value} - ${org.openmole.core.buildinfo.version.name} ", Resource.script.openmole.file, classIs(btn, btn_danger))



@h2{Run OpenMOLE}

After downloading OpenMOLE, you can launch it by executing the @i{openmole} file in the installation directory with the @code{./openmole} command.
It will bring up you web browser and you should see something like this:

@img(src := Resource.img.mole.uiScreenshot.file, `class` := "uiScreenshot", width := "100%")

OpenMOLE supports Chrome and Firefox.
If you are using another web browser, you will need to copy paste the OpenMOLE URL (something like @code{http://localhost:[port]}) in either Chrome or Firefox.



@h2{Experiment with OpenMOLE}

To get started with OpenMOLE and see a few simple use cases, you can follow our @a("Step by Step Introduction to OpenMOLE", href := stepByStepIntro.file).
Other @a("Tutorials", href := tutorials.file) are also available, and you should find all the info you need in our @a("Documentation", href := documentation.file) section.

@br

If you have questions or problems, don't hesitate to contact our great community through the @aa("forum", href := shared.link.forum) or the @aa("chat", href := shared.link.chat)!



@h2{Alternative Install}
@h3{Build From Sources}

If you prefer building the OpenMOLE application from sources you can do so as explained @aa("here", href := buildSources.file).


@h3{Run in Docker}

You can run OpenMOLE using a Docker container published @aa("on the Docker Hub", href := org.openmole.site.shared.link.dockerHub).
Running OpenMOLE using Docker images facilitates the execution of multiple instances of OpenMOLE on different ports, possibly with different versions.
It also facilitates the automatic restart of OpenMOLE or its update for a newer version.

@br

You can run it using @code{docker} or @code{docker-compose}.
In order to use the latter, follow these steps:

@ul
  @li{install @code{docker-compose}: follow @aa("the Docker documentation", href := "https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/") to install it on your system,}
  @li{create a @code{docker-compose.yml} file in a directory containing the information found @aa("on the Docker Hub", href := org.openmole.site.shared.link.dockerHub),}
  @li{edit the @code{docker-compose.yml} file as explained below,}
  @li{pull the Docker image by running @code{sudo docker-compose pull},}
  @li{start the Docker image by running @code{sudo docker-compose up -d},}
  @li{stop the Docker image by running @code{sudo docker-compose down},}
  @li{monitor the Docker image by running @code{sudo docker-compose top}, @code{sudo docker-compose ps}, or @code{sudo docker-compose logs -t}.}

In general, report to the @code{docker-compose} documentation and your favorite search engine to solve your problems.

@br

The following @code{docker-compose} configuration runs the @org.openmole.core.buildinfo.version.value OpenMOLE version.
It displays the OpenMOLE web user interface on port 55555, and mounts the local directory @code{./data/openmole} as the directory for OpenMOLE settings and results.
It also restarts automatically on failure.

@hl(s"""
version: "3"

services:
  openmole:
    image: openmole/openmole:${org.openmole.core.buildinfo.version.value}
    hostname: openmole
    volumes:
      - ./data/openmole:/var/openmole/
    ports:
      - "55555:8080"
    privileged: true
    restart: on-failure:100000
""", "plain")

To set some OpenMOLE parameters (for instance an http proxy) you can do:

@hl(s"""
version: "3"

services:
  openmole:
    image: openmole/openmole:${org.openmole.core.buildinfo.version.value}
    hostname: mymachinenetworkname.mydomain.org
    command: openmole-docker --proxy http://myproxy.mydomain.org:3128
    volumes:
      - ./data/openmole:/var/openmole/
    ports:
      - "55555:8080"
    privileged: true
    restart: on-failure:100000
""", "plain")


@h3{Get a previous version}

Previous versions of the OpenMOLE application and documentation are available @aa("here", href := shared.link.allOpenMOLE).
The previous versions logs are gathered @aa("here", href := DocumentationPages.releaseNotes.file).
